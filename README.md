# Book-Recommendation-Engine-using-KNN
Book recommendation algorithm using K-Nearest Neighbors.
In this Freecodecamp challenge, I had to create a book recommendation algorithm using K-Nearest Neighbors. I had to use the Book-Crossings dataset. This dataset contains 1.1 million ratings (scale of 1-10) of 270,000 books by 90,000 users.
